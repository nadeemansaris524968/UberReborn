# UberReborn
This is a clone of the popular ride app Uber. Again, this is just for educational purposes only. I'm using Parse Server 
hosted on Heroku to store both the rider's and driver's location and important information. The app is now complete. Users can request a ride from their location and have live updates about the driver's location who responded to their request. The driver can see all the users in his vicinity and choose any ride request to pick up that person. Once the driver has chooses his customer, he can then proceed with navigation using Apple Maps.
